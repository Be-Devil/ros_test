SURF
==========================================================

1. Use the matlab based OpenSURF from 
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28300-opensurf-including-image-warp

See @SurfPointFeature/private, it's patched

2. Use the OpenCV based SURF implementation from
http://www.maths.lth.se/matematiklth/personal/petter/surfmex.php

See @SurfPointFeature/SURFmex-v2

If you place the MEX file OpenSurf.mexXYZ into @SurfPointFeatures you
get a signicant increase in performance, but also slightly different
results.  This package has the potential to use the GPU but I haven't
gotten this going yet.

Graphseg
==========================================================


graphseg.cpp is the MATLAB callable wrapper around the graph-segmentation 
code by Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher
