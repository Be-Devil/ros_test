%IERODE Morphological erosion
%
% OUT = IERODE(IM, SE, OPTIONS) is the image IM after morphological erosion
% with the structuring element SE.
%
% OUT = IERODE(IM, SE, N, OPTIONS) as above but the structuring element 
% SE is applied N times, that is N erosions.
%
% Options::
% 'border'   the border value is replicated (default)
% 'none'     pixels beyond the border are not included in the window
% 'trim'     output is not computed for pixels where the structuring element
%            crosses the image border, hence output image had reduced 
%            dimensions.
% 'wrap'     the image is assumed to wrap around, left to right, top to
%            bottom.
% 
% Notes::
% - Cheaper to apply a smaller structuring element multiple times than
%   one large one, the effective structuing element is the Minkowski sum
%   of the structuring element with itself N times.
% - Windowing options of IMORPH can be passed.
