A number of MVTB functions are implemented as MEX files for efficiency.

If you attempted to execute one of the functions
    closest()
    fhist()
    hist2d()
    ilabel()
    imatch()
    imorph()
    irank()
    ivar()
    iwindow()
    stereo_match()

and got the message "Attempt to execute SCRIPT xxxx as a function:" you need
to compile the MEX files for your archicture.  The Toolbox ships with compiled
versions for Win32 and Maci64 architectures.

BUILDING THE MEX FILES

For Linux or MacOS just run:

% make

which assumes that the mex utility is in your current path.  This is typically
found in the bin subdirectory of your installed MATLAB.  You do of course also
need a C compiler.

For Windows:

probably easier to run the script from inside MATLAB

>> make

INSTALLING THE MEX FILE

The mex subdirectory is added to the MATLAB path by the startup_mvtb script
which is executed by the startup_rvc script.  No installation action is 
required.

Note that the .m versions of these files exist in the directory above and 
contain the online help documentation.
