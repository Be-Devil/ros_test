## Demo: Cart-pole control with the A2C (modified SAC) algorithm

- Step 1: run CoppeliaSim, import cartpole_scene.ttt
- Step 2: run visdom in your terminal, open your browser, and visit link: localhost:8097
- Step 3: run the script named 'coppeliasim_cart_pole.py' in the sub-path ‘./examples‘

Then we have:
